## React Calculator
A simple four-function calculator using React, with keyboard support and some implicit operations similar to the Windows calculator.

## How to use
* Press the buttons on the page to add, subtract, multiply, or divide non-negative whole numbers (e.g. 15 + 20 =)
* You can also use your keyboard to enter numbers, operators, compute (press equals or enter), or backspace to undo the last number
* Similar to the Windows calculator, if you press the equals button multiple times in a row, the same operation with the second operand will be repeated.  If you press an operation without specifying the second operand, the current total will be assumed to be the second operand.    

## Built With

* [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) - for operator icons
* [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - for automated testing
